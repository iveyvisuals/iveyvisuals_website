          <p>The official IveyVisuals website was developed in house...from scratch! Through a thorough process of planning, prototyping, developing, debugging, and refining, I was able to develop a website that truly encapsulates the IveyVisuals brand. Curious how it all came together? Watch through the process and behind-the-scenes posted on Instagram @iveyvisuals. </p>

          <p>Interlude is an application designed to combat the ongoing global issue of online exploitation and educate youth on how to protect themselves.
            Created for users aged 12 to 17, the interface was carefully designed with empathy and intention. A friendly and welcoming color palette was chosen to create a safe learning environment, while the overall user experience was tailored to be clear, intuitive, and engaging. Every element — from layout to interaction — was crafted to help young users navigate difficult topics with ease and confidence. </p>
