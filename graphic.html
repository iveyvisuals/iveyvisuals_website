          <h3>Merchandise Design </h3>
          <span class="pill-label">Designed for Western Ontario Organization of Filipinos</span>
         
          <p>“Pamilya,” the Tagalog word for “family,” was used as the central theme for this merchandise design. Filipino culture is deeply rooted in care, connection, and hospitality. These values are reflected in the organization’s community and spirit. Incorporating “pamilya” into the design created an opportunity to celebrate and proudly wear Filipino identity in a meaningful and unified way. </p>
