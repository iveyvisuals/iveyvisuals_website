          <h3>Social Media Branding </h3>
          <span class="pill-label">Designed for Western Ontario Organization of Filipinos</span>
          
          <p> When someone lands on your page, the visual identity sets the tone. A cohesive and engaging feed encourages visitors to keep scrolling, stay longer, and connect with your content.

            This Instagram brand theme was created for WOOF UWO, using traditional Filipino colors and cultural motifs to reflect the spirit of the club. The design aimed to capture not only WOOF’s vibrant community, but also its deep roots in heritage and unity. From highlight covers to post graphics, every visual was curated to feel bold, expressive, and uniquely WOOF.

          <h3>Brand Refresh </h3>
          <span class="pill-label">Designed for Kenzo Ramen</span>
          
          <p>This rebrand was pursued as a self-initiated project to practice and expand branding skills. Inspired by the visual identity of the well-known ramen house, this concept aimed to give Kenzo Ramen a fresh, modern look while staying rooted in its cultural origins.

            Research into Japanese design principles and traditional aesthetics informed the color palette, typography, and visual motifs. Key elements from the original branding were thoughtfully retained and reimagined to ensure a sense of familiarity and brand continuity.
            
          </p>
          <p> Note: This project was done independently and is not affiliated with Kenzo Ramen.</p>
